## General Information
As a data scientist, my coding experience, as of a few months ago, have mostly been via Jupyter Notebooks. For the last few months, I have been trying to learn how write production-ready code that isn't just spaghetti code in a notebook. This package is a culmination of sorts of my learnings from the past few months, so while `stableperovskites` is technically a regression model, I intended this project to show my skills in writing production-ready code, such as (but not limited to):
- Automated testing with tox and pytest
- Logging with loguru
- Static typing with mypy
- Data validation and settings management with pydantic
- Automated building, testing, and deployment with GitHub Actions


## Usage
The project is meant to be consumed via [API](http://stableperovskites-api.fly.dev). The code for said API is also available in a separate [repo](https://github.com/machinelurning/stableperovskites-api).
